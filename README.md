As someone who is looking to get into the Data Analysis field, I've created projects showcasing my abilities in important Data Analysis skills such as
Excel, Python and Tableau.
In SQL, I used CTEs, data operations and SQL functions to find insights into the data. I used Views to create tables showing only the data needed to make
a particular analysis.
In Excel, I cleaned data by removing repetitive data and used conditional formatting to find outlier data and remove it. With the data cleaned, I proceeded
to create pivot tables to find the relation between various factors such as cost, number of bedrooms, area and furnishing status.
In Python, I used Python libraries to conduct data analysis to create a guide for high school students and college applicants to select a major and college
based on earning potential.
